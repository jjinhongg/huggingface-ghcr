# ðŸ¤— Hugging Face packaging using GitHub Container Registry

Learn how to create a container and package it with GitHub Actions. This repository gives us a good starting point for a Dockerfile, GitHub Actions workflow, and Python code.

The web application uses FastAPI with Hugging Face and exposes a single endpoint that you can interact with it. 

Run the GitHub Actions as-is to register your own containerized application.
